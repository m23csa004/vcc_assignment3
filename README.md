Auto-Scaling in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ðŸš€
Overview
This project demonstrates auto-scaling in GCP based on local CPU utilization. It uses a Flask application running on a local VM (VirtualBox) that monitors CPU usage and automatically triggers GCP instance creation when the utilization exceeds a predefined threshold.
